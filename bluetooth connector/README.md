# Bluetooth connector

To make use of this workflow first install Bluetooth connector

```
brew install bluetoothconnector
```

## Connect to device:

```
btc a
```

## Disconnect from device

```
btd a
```

The argument can be one of the following (more to come)

- `a` (Airpods)
- `t` (Trackpad)
- `h` (Sony Headphones
